Dal baati churma thaali: the baati was good and well cooked, but the other things were not up to the mark. \\n2. Rajasthani thali: there was no taste in kair sangri and aalu pyaz ki sabzi. Being in rajasthan, you atleast expect the rajasthani thali to taste good. \\n3. Tandoori momos: the least expected dish turned out to be above average but not that great. \\n\\nOverall our experience was not that good.

The sweet Lassi served in earthern glasses, is pure bliss in every sip. The Kachori, also is like a blast of flavours in mouth, served hot of course. Do take the chutney with Kachori , works as a punchy taste enhancer. You can add Jalebis to this, to make this combination even better. Though, the quality is declining,but still one of the best in Jaipur.\\n\\nThis place is also loved and well renowned for sweets, and people will recommend most of these.\\n\\nService - 3/5\\nThey're quick. But there's not much interaction, they cannot help with your offer neither they are friendly. But does the job. \\n                                                \\n\",\n",
